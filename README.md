## About

> To share knowledge and have fun.

React Knowledgeable is a talk series focusing on technology, ideas, and experiences as a React developer at Shopee.

We happen _every Friday in our last working hour_. This means 6pm nearly all Fridays, with the exception of public holidays, or in collision with other company events.

You can find all our talk information and schedules in [our issues](https://github.com/Shopee/react-knowledgeable/issues).
