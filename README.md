## Guest Visits

Albeit we are an internal sharing, we welcome guests to come hear what we have to share, give a talk, or just to chill out. As a courtesy to @Shopee, please do not use this as an opportunity for hiring.

To participate in `<RK />`, you may

- [Schedule a guest visit](https://github.com/Shopee/react-knowledgeable/issues/new?assignees=&labels=visit&template=visit.md&title=)
- [Propose a talk](https://github.com/Shopee/react-knowledgeable/issues/new?assignees=&labels=talk&template=talk.md&title=%F0%9F%91%BE)

In the rare occasion where the talks are not suitable to be open and when we are unable to accommodate external guests, we will mark the event as private.

To guarantee your access to our talks, please arrive at least 10 minutes before the talk starts so that our organizers may escort you into our office.

## CoC

Any participants, including internal team members, speakers and guests, are required to agree to our [Code of Conduct](CoC.md).
